Statistics: Descriptive & Inferential

Descriptive - concise summary of the data (tables, average values, deviations and visualizations)
Inferential - infer parameters of population based on sample (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, linear regression)

Types of variables

- Numerical: integer or continuous. Examples: temperature, height
- Ordinal. Example: clothing size S, M, L
- Categorical. Examples: Gender, eye colour 


Statistical research project:
1.  Define the research topic and the relevant research questions.
2.  Define of the population and the variables of interest.
3.  Plan of the sample collection such that it is representative of thepopulation.
4.  Collect the sample.
5.  Organize the sample.
6.  Study the sample using descriptive statistics.
7.  Model and analyze the sample using inferential statistics.
8.  Evaluate the results critically.
9.  Communicate the (lack of) findings.

Different statistical studyies:
* Observational research - observe the sample without changing conditions.
* Controlled research - examine eefect of one variable to another by controlling existing conditions. Example: Dividing patients into groups who are treated with placebo and medicine. 
* Simulation - use mathematical modeling to mimic natural process. Example: spread of virus is studyied using mathematical model.
